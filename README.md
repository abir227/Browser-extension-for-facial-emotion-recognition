# Deep-Learning-computer-vision-Academic-Project
### Introduction
Our project is grounded in research, specifically inspired by the insights presented in the article titled "Artificial Neural Network Based Ensemble Approach for Multicultural Facial Expressions Analysis".
Our research began with a thorough examination of various facial datasets, leading us to select the affectnet dataset.
We proceeded to train diverse deep learning models, adjusting their parameters to effectively classify emotions. 
###
The models employed in our study included:
- **VGG19**
- **ResNet50**
- **Xception**
- **Coursera CNN model**

Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of these models, ultimately choosing to ensemble the most effective ones.

### Model Deployment
To make our model accessible, we deployed it as a web extension developed using JavaScript.
